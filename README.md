# Ubiqum_energy_consumption

The task is to analyse a household energy consumption data. The datasets spreads over almost four years on a minutely frequency
and was collected by three individual submeters and an overall meter.

I used cluster analyses to identify patterns over the days of a week in terms of energy consumption and of 
which part of the appartment was active and to what extent.

The main findings were that patterns could be identified and particularly this households cycle can be described by 2-4 clusters per a day.
It is interesting as well that weekend follows simpler patterns compared to the weekdays.

The results could be used for making plans for potential new appartments' electricity system, or for benchmarking,
to provide operational framework for a warning system.
